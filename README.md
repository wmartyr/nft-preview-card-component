## My process

I started doing the HTML and then styled with CSS. I tried styling this one first using mobile widths and worked up to desktop sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This one took me a lot of googling and testing stuff out to get the hover effects right. 
First, I had to set the cards in a fixed width so I can fit the tint overlay exactly the right size over the image.
Then I had to use opacity to get it and the "eye" icon to appear when hovering. There might be a better way to do this than what I've done.


### Continued development

I think I need to have more practice in doing CSS effects. 
I also need to list down web pages where I've gotten a push in the right direction to complete this so I can acknowledge them in this document.
